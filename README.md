# Odd Jobs Backend

> This is the frontend part of our group project, Odd Jobs, a mobile app to help connect members of the community who require, or wish to offer, help with odd jobs. Users have the ability to either post a job, or respond to a posted job. There is also an integrated chat feature which enables users to communicate about a job. The user’s location is pinned to a map which displays jobs in the surrounding area.
 
The repo for the frontend can be found here:
